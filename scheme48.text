Usage: /usr/local/lib/scheme48-1.9.2/scheme48vm [options] [-a arguments]
Options: -h <heap-size>    Maximum heap size in words (default 4000000).
                           A heap size of 0 means the heap can grow
                           unboundedly. This is dangerous because it can
                           cause your system to run out of memory.
	 -s <stack-size>   Stack buffer size in words.
         -i <file>         Load image from file (default "scheme48.image")
